# DEVCONTAINER

This is a devcontainer folder with little modifications, following [EvilMartians System of a Test blog post](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/system-of-a-test-setting-up-end-to-end-rails-testing):

* It uses [Cuprite](https://github.com/rubycdp/cuprite) instead of [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) for running end to end tests with Capybara.
* It uses has a chrome container for running tests in separate.

There are changes to be performed in the project's Gemfile. Please, follow Konnor's [evil_system](https://github.com/KonnorRogers/evil_systems) explanation.

PD: I'll probably create an application template with all the different modifications I like.
